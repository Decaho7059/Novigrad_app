# 🏙️ Novigrad – Municipal Service Management Application
> Academic project developed by **Decaho Gbegbe** as part of the **SEG2505 – Introduction to Software Development** course at the **University of Ottawa (Fall 2024)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Novigrad** is a simulated municipal service management system built entirely in **Java**, where different user roles — *employees*, *managers*, and *clients* — interact with city-style services such as driver’s license renewals, form submissions, and document verification.

The goal of this project was to apply the **core principles of software engineering** covered in **SEG2505**, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture
- UML modeling and documentation
- Input validation and exception handling
- Unit testing and version control
- Collaborative software development practices

## ⚙️ Technologies and Tools

| 🧩 Technology / Tool | 💡 Purpose |
|----------------------|------------|
| ☕ **Java (JDK 17+)** | Main programming language |
| 🎨 **JavaFX** | Graphical user interface (GUI) |
| 🧠 **MVC Architecture** | Separation of model, view, and controller layers |
| 🧪 **JUnit** | Unit testing and quality assurance |
| 🗂️ **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaboration |
| 🧱 **UML Diagrams** | System design and modeling |
| 📄 **JavaDoc** | Code documentation and maintainability |

## 🚀 Key Features

- 👤 **User Management** – Register, log in, and manage roles (Client, Employee, Manager)  
- 🏢 **Service Management** – Create, modify, and delete municipal services  
- 📁 **Document Handling** – Upload, review, and validate client documents  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – File-based system for data persistence  
- 🕹️ **Interactive GUI** – Intuitive JavaFX-based user interface  
- ⚠️ **Input Validation** – Error handling and user feedback mechanisms  
- 📊 **Reporting (optional)** – View and manage service statistics

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project reinforced hands-on understanding of:

- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**  
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**  
- **Exception Handling and Validation**  
- **Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)**  
- **File I/O Operations** for saving and loading data  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using JUnit  
- **Git Collaboration Workflow** (branches, commits, merges, pull requests)
