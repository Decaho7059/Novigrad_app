# 🏙️ Novigrad – Municipal Service Management Application
> Academic project developed by **Decaho Gbegbe** as part of the **SEG2505 – Introduction to Software Development** course at the **University of Ottawa (Fall 2024)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Novigrad** is a simulated municipal service management system built entirely in **Java**, where different user roles — *employees*, *managers*, and *clients* — interact with city-style services such as driver’s license renewals, form submissions, and document verification.

The purpose of this project was to apply the **core principles of software engineering** taught in the SEG2505 course, including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Model–View–Controller (MVC) software design
- UML modeling and documentation
- Input validation and exception handling
- Unit testing and version control
